"""
Note: As an optimisation to prevent unnecessary allocations, the addr, adv_data,
char_data, notify_data, and uuid entries in the tuples are read-only memoryview instances
pointing to bluetoothâ€™s internal ringbuffer, and are only valid during the invocation of 
the IRQ handler function. If your program needs to save one of these values to access 
after the IRQ handler has returned (e.g. by saving it in a class instance or global 
variable), then it needs to take a copy of the data, either by using bytes() or 
bluetooth.UUID()
